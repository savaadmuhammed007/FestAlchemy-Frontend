## 🔐 Multi-Role Portals & Features

FestAlchemy features a secure, token-based role authentication system with four distinct portals:

### 1. 📢 Public Dashboard (`/`)
An interactive, live-updating screen for general participants and visitors.
* **Live Points Table:** Real-time team leaderboards showing ranks, gold, silver, and bronze trophies.
* **Top Performers Ledger:** Filterable directory showing individual champion rankings categorized by age and event categories.
* **Schedules & Stages:** Real-time visibility into stage statuses, upcoming programs, and live announcements.
* **Official Results:** Instant display of published rankings and certificates.

### 2. 👑 Admin Panel (`/admin`)
A comprehensive management cockpit for festival coordinators.
* **Dashboard Overview:** Displays live key metrics (registered participants, event completion rates, judge submissions).
* **Programs Setup:** Create, edit, and configure events (specifying categories, chest number ranges, max marks, and stages).
* **Members Registry:** Manage all participants; supports manual registration as well as bulk data importing.
* **Judge Assignments:** Allocate credentials and assign specific judges to manage marking directories.
* **Grade Rules Configurator:** Set grade boundaries (e.g., A Grade >= 80%) and the associated points weighting.
* **Interactive SpinLot Machine:** A digital lottery machine utilizing randomized wheels to assign performance slots or chest numbers.
* **Real-time Marksheet Monitor:** Keep track of which judges have submitted or saved drafts for assigned programs.
* **Results Compilation & Publishing:** Automatically tabulate results, calculate ties, and broadcast official results to the public dashboard.
* **Poster & Certificate Editor:** A visual, canvas-like template editor to design announcement flyers and print winner certificates dynamically.

### 3. ⚖️ Judge Portal (`/judge`)
A mobile-friendly, streamlined interface optimized for real-time scoring.
* **Assigned Program Directory:** List of events where the user is selected as a panel judge.
* **Marksheet Scoring Sheets:** Allows entry of marks for each participant with strict limit validation (based on event `max_marks`).
* **Draft Saving & Final Submission:** Supports saving drafts to edit later and locking final scores to prevent modifications.

### 4. 📣 Team Lead Portal (`/teamlead`)
A localized workspace for organization coordinators.
* **Team Members Registry:** View and audit registered participants under their team.
* **Register Participants:** Create new members under specific categories, generating unified chest numbers automatically.
* **Event Registrations:** Add or modify event assignments for team members subject to category constraints.

## ⚡ Developer Guidelines & Style System

### Custom CSS Variables (`index.css`)
We avoid TailwindCSS and maintain styling inside `src/index.css`. All colors, animations, and shadows are defined as theme variables. Examples include:
* **Backgrounds:** `--bg-base` (`#0f1117`), `--bg-raised` (`#181c26`), and `--bg-overlay`.
* **Colors:** `--accent` (`#6366f1` Indigo), `--info`, `--success`, `--warning`, `--danger`.
* **Transitions:** Smooth UI animations are run using `transition: all var(--dur) var(--ease)`.
* **Theme Switching:** Modifying theme applies a `data-theme` attribute to the `html` element which updates variable tokens automatically.

### Authentication & API Routing (`AuthContext.jsx`)
* **API URL:** By default, calls are made to the local Django server: `http://localhost:8000`.
* **Token Storage:** Authenticated session tokens are persisted in `localStorage` as `token`.
* **Headers:** Requests to protected endpoints must carry the header `'Authorization': 'Token <your_token>'`.
